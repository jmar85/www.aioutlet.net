## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Problem 1: "403 Forbidden" Error**

**Solution:**
- Make sure `index.html` is directly in `public_html`
- NOT in a subfolder like `public_html/dist/`

### **Problem 2: Website Shows Old Content**

**Solution:**
- Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
- Try in incognito/private mode
- Wait 5-10 minutes for DNS to update

### **Problem 3: CSS/Styles Not Loading**

**Solution:**
- Check that `assets` folder is in `public_html`
- Make sure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Check File Manager permissions (should be 644)

### **Problem 4: Blank White Page**

**Solution:**
- Right-click → View Page Source
- Check if HTML is loading
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify all files uploaded correctly
